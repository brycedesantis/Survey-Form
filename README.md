# Survey-Form
A survey form made in html and css as part of a freeCodeCamp course to learn responsive web design. While simplistic in nature the project helped me learn a lot about the funtionality of html and css. There are style choices that I feel as I made that are not consistent with modern css styling, however I anticipate being able to learn from the mistakes I have made in this form and in due time updating the look and functionality of the form. There are several style choices that I feel were able to enhance the project, one being the color choices of the background and the submit button. I choose a cream color for the background out randomly however, I decieded it would be beneficial to choose a complimentary color for the submit but as to not ditract from the user experience.
